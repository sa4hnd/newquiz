# Quiz Application with MySQL and Prisma Integration

## Path System Prompt:

You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, and Tailwind CSS. Follow the Next.js documentation for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing. and i use pnpm

## App Description:

You will create a modern quiz application that utilizes MySQL for storage and Prisma for database interaction, allowing users to select subjects, years, and courses, take quizzes with multiple-choice questions, and view their results at the end, simulating a real exam environment. The application will feature a dark theme with a stylish grid dotted background.

## App Flow and Functionality:

1. **User Interface:**

   - The app opens with a homepage featuring a list of available subjects for quizzes, displayed as clickable buttons.

2. **Subject Selection:**

   - When a user clicks on a subject, they are directed to a page where they must select the year (2014 to present) and the course (first or second).

3. **Year and Course Selection:**

   - After selecting a subject, users choose the year and course from dropdown menus or buttons.
   - Once selections are made, users can navigate to the quiz page.

4. **Quiz Taking:**

   - Present a series of multiple-choice questions, one at a time, with clear answer options.
   - Include a timer to simulate a real exam environment.
   - Users can mark questions for review and navigate between questions.

5. **Submission and Results:**

   - Upon completing the quiz, users submit their answers.
   - Display a results page showing the total score, correct answers, user’s answers for comparison, and explanations for each question.

6. **Quiz History:**

   - Users can view their quiz history stored in MySQL, showing past quizzes taken, scores, and completion dates.

7. **Admin Panel:**

   - An admin interface for managing questions and user access.
   - Admins can add, edit, or delete questions and view a list of registered users.

### Key Features to Implement:

- **User Authentication:**

  - Implement user authentication using a suitable package (e.g., NextAuth.js or custom JWT) to secure access for students and admins.

- **Prisma for Data Storage:**

  - Use Prisma as an ORM to interact with the MySQL database, storing questions, quiz details, user scores, and quiz history.
  - Organize data into tables for subjects, questions, and users.

- **Dynamic Quiz Loading:**

  - Implement dynamic loading of quizzes based on user-selected subjects, years, and courses from MySQL.

- **Admin Interface:**

  - Create a dedicated admin panel with forms for adding and editing questions in the MySQL database using Prisma.
  - Implement validation for input fields.

- **Timer and Navigation:**

  - Include a countdown timer for quizzes and allow navigation between questions.

- **Comprehensive Results Display:**

  - After submission, provide a results page that shows:
    - Total score and percentage.
    - Detailed comparison of the user’s answers versus the correct answers.
    - Feedback on each question.

- **Dark Theme and Stylish Background:**

  - Implement a modern dark theme throughout the application.
  - Use a grid-looking dotted background for a contemporary feel.

- **Responsive Design:**

  - Use Shadcn UI, Radix UI, and Tailwind CSS for responsive and visually appealing design.

- **Error Handling:**

  - Ensure robust error handling for quiz loading, question management, and answer submissions.

### Required Components:

Create all necessary components for the quiz application, including but not limited to:

- `subject-list.tsx` for displaying available subjects.
- `year-selector.tsx` for selecting the year.
- `course-selector.tsx` for selecting the course.
- `quiz-selection.tsx` for presenting available quizzes based on selections.
- `quiz.tsx` for displaying questions and answer options, including a timer.
- `result-display.tsx` for showing final scores and comparisons after quiz submission.
- `quiz-history.tsx` for displaying user quiz history.
- `admin-panel.tsx` for managing questions and users.

and this is what we did yesterday

hank you for providing the comprehensive update on your project. It's clear that you've made significant progress on the Fergeh quiz application. Here's a summary of the current state and structure of your project:
The application now uses MySQL with Prisma for data storage and management. 2. You've implemented key pages such as the admin dashboard, quiz page, results page, and error handling.
The UI is styled using Tailwind CSS with a dark theme and gradient backgrounds.
You're using Shadcn UI components for consistent styling.
The application handles subjects, years, courses, and questions.
You've implemented features like a timer for quizzes, question navigation, and result sharing.
For tomorrow, you might want to consider the following tasks:
Implement any missing API routes (e.g., for subjects, years, courses).
Enhance the admin interface to allow editing and deleting questions.
Implement user authentication and authorization.
Add pagination for questions in the admin dashboard.
Implement a user profile page with quiz history.
Add more advanced quiz features like difficulty levels or categorized quizzes.
Optimize database queries and implement caching where appropriate.
Add more comprehensive error handling and loading states.
Implement automated testing for critical components and API routes.
Good night! When you resume work tomorrow, this summary should help you quickly get back into the context of your project and continue development efficiently.
